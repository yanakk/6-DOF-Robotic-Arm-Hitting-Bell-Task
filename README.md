# 6-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Hitting-Bell-Task
One of the projects of the "Robot Design and Practice" course for the 2019-2020 academic year. Work with two teammates.

Task1: Complete the calculation of the DH parameters of the manipulator model and the kinematics of the robot arm.
Task2: Write the code to calculate the Jacobian matrix and then control the speed of the end of the robotic arm.
Task3: Calculate the inverse kinematics of the robot arm at some given points. Use the obtained joint angle to plan the trajectory, and use the fifth-order polynomial to interpolate the trajectory of the manipulator. The path control of the end of the manipulator is realized by the way of speed control through the fifth-order polynomial.
Task4: Keep the end of the robotic arm at the initial position and rotate at a fixed point here.
**Task5: Hitting-Bell Task.** Make the robotic arm move as quickly as possible to avoid obstacles and ring the bells. Within the specified time, the team that rings the bells more has a higher score.

Corresponding codes are in the *src* folder.
